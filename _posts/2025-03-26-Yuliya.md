# TorchServe library​

The "ShellTorch" vulnerability refers to a set of critical security flaws discovered in TorchServe, an open-source tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models. These vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on affected systems, potentially leading to server takeover. ​

​OpenAI GPT models: These models are not directly affected by the ShellTorch vulnerabilities, as they do not rely on TorchServe for deployment.​
Oligo
​Google BERT library: BERT is a separate natural language processing model developed by Google and does not utilize TorchServe.​
​TensorFlow models: TensorFlow is a different machine learning framework that does not depend on TorchServe for model serving.​
Therefore, the ShellTorch vulnerabilities specifically impact the TorchServe library.​
